Project Objective :
The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive financial report for credit card transactions using Power BI and PostgreSQL. The report aims to provide insights into customer spending behavior, transaction patterns, and financial health of the credit card portfolio.

Skills Utilized 

1.Data Analytics

2.Data Visualization

3.SQL (PostgreSQL)

4.DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

5.Power BI

6.ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

7.Data Modeling

Dataset Information 

The dataset for this project includes the following tables:

Customers: Information about credit card holders (customer ID, demographics, etc.)

Transactions: Detailed transaction records (transaction ID, date, amount, merchant, etc.)

Accounts: Account information linked to customers (account ID, balance, credit limit, etc.)

Payments: Records of payments made towards credit card balances (payment ID, amount, date, etc.)

Steps Involved

1. Data Extraction
Extracted data from PostgreSQL database using SQL queries.

3. Data Transformation
Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and anomalies.
Transformed data to create meaningful metrics and dimensions required for analysis.

5. Data Loading
Loaded the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI for further analysis.

7. Data Modeling
Established relationships between different tables to create a cohesive data model.
Defined calculated columns and measures using DAX for advanced analytics.

9. Data Visualization
Created interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI.
Visualized key metrics such as total spend, average transaction value, payment behavior, etc.

Insights

Customer Segmentation: Identified different customer segments based on spending patterns and demographics.

Spending Trends: Analyzed monthly and yearly spending trends to understand peak periods and average transaction values.

Merchant Analysis: Identified top merchants and categories where customers spend the most.

Payment Behavior: Assessed payment patterns and identified customers who frequently pay late or default on payments.

Credit Utilization: Monitored credit card utilization rates to identify over-leveraged customers.

Action Items

Risk Management: Implement strategies to mitigate risk for customers with high credit utilization or poor payment behavior.

Customer Loyalty Programs: Develop loyalty programs for top-spending customers to enhance retention.

Merchant Partnerships: Forge partnerships with popular merchants to offer exclusive discounts and promotions.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of combining data analytics and visualization tools to derive actionable insights from credit card transaction data. By leveraging Power BI and PostgreSQL, we were able to create a comprehensive financial report that can guide strategic decisions in the credit card business.
